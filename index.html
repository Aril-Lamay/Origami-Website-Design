                    <li>Chameleons change their color due to factors like their mood, changes in light or temperature, or the humidity of their environment.</li>
                    <li>They can move their eyes separately, with each eye having a field of 180 degrees. This means they can see 360 degrees if they need to.</li>
                    <li>Excluding their tail, some chameleons’ tongues can be twice the length of their body. Their tongues consist of both muscles and bones and can bend round to grab their prey.</li>

                    <li>Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition. </li>
                    <li>Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.</li>
                    <li>Pigeons use a range of skills, such as using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’.</li>

                    <li>The word or name ‘teddy bear’ comes from the nickname of Theodore Roosevelt. He, of course, was a former president of the United States of America.</li>
                    <li> Morris Michtom created the teddy bear. However, when it was placed in the window of a shop it was not known as a ‘teddy bear’, but as ‘Teddy’s bear’.</li>
                    <li>The world’s largest teddy bear collection has 20,367 teddies in it. This collection is owned by Istvánné Arnócaki from Hungary</li>

                    <li> Pandas are BIG eaters – every day they fill their tummies for up to 12 hours, shifting up to 12 kilograms of bamboo!</li>
                    <li>These magnificent mammals are omnivores. But whilst pandas will occasionally eat small animals and fish, bamboo counts for 99 percent of their diet.</li>
                    <li> Unlike most other bears, pandas do not hibernate. When winter approaches, they head lower down their mountain homes to warmer temperatures, where they continue to chomp away on bamboo!</li>

                <ol>
                    <li> Cicada eggs hatch in only about 6 weeks after being laid by an adult female, and the adults themselves only live 4-6 weeks before dying. However the cicada nymphs can live underground eating roots and preparing for the day that they rise to the surface, for 13-17 years.</li>
                    <li>Some species of cicada can make sounds that reach up to 120 decibels which is equivalent to a loud rock concert. It’s that loud.</li>
                    <li>They can look a bit intimidating with their big read eyes, large wings, and scary noise, but cicadas are harmless to humans.</li>
