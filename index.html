        <p><i>Interesting facts about chameleons</i></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Chameleons change their color due to factors like their mood, changes in light or temperature, or the humidity of their environment.</li>
            <li>They can move their eyes separately, with each eye having a field of 180 degrees. This means they can see 360 degrees if they need to.</li>
            <li>Excluding their tail, some chameleons’ tongues can be twice the length of their body. Their tongues consist of both muscles and bones and can bend round to grab their prey.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition. </li>
            <li>Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.</li>
            <li>Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use a range of skills, such as using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’.</li>

        <p><i>Interesting facts about teddy bears</i></p>
        <ol>
            <li>The word or name ‘teddy bear’ comes from the nickname of Theodore Roosevelt. He, of course, was a former president of the United States of America.</li>
            <li> Morris Michtom created the teddy bear. However, when it was placed in the window of a shop it was not known as a ‘teddy bear’, but as ‘Teddy’s bear’.</li>
            <li>The world’s largest teddy bear collection has 20,367 teddies in it. This collection is owned by Istvánné Arnócaki from Hungary</li>

        <p><i>Interesting facts about pandas</i></p>
        <ul>
            <li> Pandas are BIG eaters – every day they fill their tummies for up to 12 hours, shifting up to 12 kilograms of bamboo!</li>
            <li>These magnificent mammals are omnivores. But whilst pandas will occasionally eat small animals and fish, bamboo counts for 99 percent of their diet.</li>
            <li> Unlike most other bears, pandas do not hibernate. When winter approaches, they head lower down their mountain homes to warmer temperatures, where they continue to chomp away on bamboo!</li>
        </ul>

        <p><i>Interesting facts about cicadas</i></p>
        <ol>
            <li> Cicada eggs hatch in only about 6 weeks after being laid by an adult female, and the adults themselves only live 4-6 weeks before dying. However the cicada nymphs can live underground eating roots and preparing for the day that they rise to the surface, for 13-17 years.</li>
            <li>If there’s one thing we think of when we think of cicadas, it’s the incredibly loud noise. Some species of cicada can make sounds that reach up to 120 decibels which is equivalent to a loud rock concert. It’s that loud.</li>
            <li>They can look a bit intimidating with their big read eyes, large wings, and scary noise, but cicadas are harmless to humans.</li>
